# Aging in the City: Understanding NYCâ€™s Older Population and Their Access to Services

This project explores the demographic distribution and service accessibility for NYC's older population using Census data and senior services datasets. By combining geospatial and demographic analysis, the project aims to identify gaps in service coverage and provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

## Project Overview

### Research Questions

1. **Who is the older population in NYC right now, and how has that changed (increased/decreased, socioeconomic) in recent decades?**
2. **Where are older adults living? Are there pockets of concentrated older adult populations?**
3. **What city services are available to older New Yorkers, and how are they distributed compared to where older adult populations are concentrated?**

This project provides data-driven insights for community boards, local leaders, policymakers, and NYC residents who wish to improve services for the city's aging population.
